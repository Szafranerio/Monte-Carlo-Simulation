Monte Carlo Simulation is a mathematical technique used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event or scenario. It involves generating random variables for uncertain inputs over a large number of iterations to simulate a range of possible outcomes. This method is used across various fields, including finance, engineering, project management, and physics, to assess risk, understand variability, and make better decisions under uncertainty. By aggregating the outcomes from these simulations, analysts can obtain probability distributions of different results, helping them to understand the likelihood of various scenarios and make informed decisions.
